Reflections on past week:

For the most part, the group as a whole felt as though we all had a good week. Good week: homework was completed and
enjoyable, office hours were very helpful (Paul, Tanner, and Eric were very helpful). Wes and Kristi were very inform-
ative and had a great dynamic when presenting, however, the matererial we learned this past week could have been 
better --vague statement.

Goals for this week:

Complete homework in swift.
Start homework early and attend office hours to be on top of everything. And review some of the basics to get a better
understanding.
Review more information on APIs and Core Data to make it more understandable and convenient when coding. Also, to 
communicate with Wes and Kristi.
Be able to replicate a code sample from CocoaControls for personal projects. Work on more API projects.

Jaguar ----OUT!
