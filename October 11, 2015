Reflections on past week:

Homework was tough, but it was completable with the help of other classmates.
Increased the utilization of classmates as a resource when completing assignments and understanding concepts.
Have been working on better understanding core data and reviewing tutorials on the topic. Going over the API assign-
ments and core data projects.
Past week was cool and learned how to delete a cell. 

Goals for this week:

Finish the MVP by midweek and continue to work on the project.
Catching up with core data and any incomplete assignments.
Continue to study and prepare for the assessment.
