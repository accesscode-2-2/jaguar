Felicia: The week was long, didn't realize that a TA showed up for Office Hours on Wednesday. 

Baraket: We should take some initiative with studying together.

Eric: Doesn't think Office Hours is worth it if there are 4 - 5 students and 1 TA available. We should use the Teaching 
Fellows more.

Christella: Wen't over the stuff leading up to the homework. Started HW on Thursday. 

Jovanni: Week was pretty good. Put in almost 15 hours in studying.

Group Goals.

-----------------

Be awesome. Get everything done. Invest 10 hours into studying. 

Study API's. Go to office hours. Be cool.
